        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Internal dialogues</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 2, 2016</p>
        <p>I already touched a little bit on how we approach reality through our senses. Then our set of past experience is used to mentally label whatever our eyes land on. Another aspect of perception is obviously the thoughts that it generates in us.</p>
        <p>When I look around, my mind is usually busy creating thoughts about whatever it is I am looking at. It draws the content of the thoughts from my memories, but also from my beliefs, my fears and my fantasies.</p>
        <p>Just like anything related to perception, these thoughts are highly personal and subjective. It's not something we can share. We can of course trying to explain with words or drawings what we're thinking but it always end up being a mere approximation.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this blog is sharing experiences, so today I'll share my thoughts with you. As you view the VR scene of today, you'll notice some blocks floating around. When you look at them (use the cursor to align), a thought about the object that hovers it appears. Look at the block on my T-shirt and you'll see what it reminds me of.</p>
        <p>This VR scene also allowed me to experiment with annotating 360 scenes. This is something I want to explore as I feel that there is value in doing it, in a form or another.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Culture and personality</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">December 1, 2016</p>
        <p>I would define a culture as a set of beliefs and customs shared by a human group. In that respect it's not much different to an individual personality. I'd use similar words to define the character of someone.</p>
        <p>I believe that when a person gets in contact with a culture that closely resembles its personality, they experience a feeling of intimacy, of being at home.</p>
        <p>Hawaii has an interesting culture. From what I can see, it has elements of western and eastern cultures. This have to be a reflection of its geographic location. Hawaii is also a favourite destination for Japanese tourists. There is an abundance of signs and conversations in Japanese here (this is why the subtitle of this experiment is VRにっき).</p>
        <p>The Japanese culture and language are an important part of my daily life and personality. To that regard it closely resembles the culture of Hawaii, a mix between western and Japanese culture. This must be the reason why I felt like at home when I arrived here.</p>
        <p>In today's VR experiment, I invite you to experience this being-at-home feeling of Hawaii the way I experience it. Like yesterday, if you look down, you'll see 2 boxes. Look at them successively to change the feeling of the scene. One is in English, the other one is in Japanese. This scene also have ambient sounds with mostly English and Japanese speakers respectively. Make sure to mute or put on headphones before trying it.</p>
        <p>Try the Japanese version if you're not used to that language, then switch to the English one. The way you feel about the English one should give you an idea of how the Japanese version feels to me.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Questioning reality</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 30, 2016</p>
        <p>I have been questioning reality a lot lately. What we call reality is a personal and subjective experience. We take it for the truth but we also know that our senses are highly inaccurate and unreliable.</p>
        <p>The truth is perceived through the lens of our senses and it seems to me that direct access to truth is not humanly possible, at least no through perception.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, I was standing on a beach, starring at the sea. I saw the sea as blue because I hold the concept of blue inside my mind. I perceived this landscape as relaxing, peaceful because these are concepts I have experienced before.</p>
        <p>But this is simply mental labelling. My mind judges and attaches concepts to the product of my perception. The reality is actually colourless, tasteless, odourless and with no sound. My experience of the world is an interpretation of my perception. There is no objective experience in human terms.</p>
        <p>I always had this theory that what I call blue may be perceived as my red for other people. There is no reference frame to compare our respective perceptions.</p>
        <p>As this concept relates closely to VR, I'll come back to it later.</p>
        <p>In today VR view, if you look down, you'll see 3 boxes. Lay your gaze on them to change the colours of the scene and experience what may be my perception of the world in your frame of reference.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Being a tree</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 29, 2016</p>

        <p>I arrived yesterday at Honolulu. It was an exhausting journey, but now it's already forgot, already forgiven.<br>
          I can't believe that about 24 hours ago I was wearing a winter coat and a woolie hat, making my way to Heathrow.
        </p>
        <p>After waking up this morning, I was eager to explore the surroundings. I headed straight away to Waikiki Beach, a mere 5 minutes from my Airbnb.</p>
        <p>Shortly after my breakfast, I found the tree pictured in today's view. It's located right on the side of the road in the seafront. It is pretty impressive with its branches turning into roots. It seems to offer me a shelter while being entirely open.</p>
        <p>It made me wonder what it's like to be a tree. Being a living creature without self-consciousness as we experience it, does it mean that trees are not aware of other beings? If so, they must see us as what we are, without under- or over-estimating us.</p>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>This is a temporary experience that uses VR to immerse an audience (you) inside personal experiences (me).</p>
        <p>It takes the form of a blog and is designed to last for 6 days, that is the duration of my holidays in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>It's recommended to use a pair of Google cardboard to enjoy the VR views.</p>
